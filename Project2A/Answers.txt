Why does it take iterations before errors are seen?
    example, 12 threads, 2 iteratiosn each will still give the right answers
    if it takes more time for a thread to be created then it takes for a thread to run, then the threads never bump into one another   
    if thread 1 is done before thread 2 is started, no problem
    when iterations go up, thread 1 doesnt finish before thread 2 is created, which creates the issues
    less iterations -> less chances to go wrong, less threads competing for resources

Cost of yielding
    why are --yield runs so much slower
        needs to switch threads 
    where is the time going
        context switch (better for threads than process)
    is it possible to get valid per-op timings if we are using --yield
        time of op + time of context switch go together
