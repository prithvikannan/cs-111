File Descriptors:
    0: standard input (read only)
    1: standard output (write only)
    2: standard error (write only)


Input/output redirection is accomplished by:
    - opening the new input/output file
    - closing the file descriptor (0, 1, 2) to be replaced
    - duplicate the new input/output file to the (newly vacated) file descriptor to be replaced
    - close the (now redundant) file descriptor on to which that file was originally opened
    Input:
        int ifd = open(newfile, O_RDONLY);
        if (ifd >= 0) {
            close(0); // closes existing std in 
            dup(ifd); // puts ifd into fd0
            close(ifd);
        }
    Output:
        // 0222 is read, 0444 is write, 0666 is read/write;
        int ofd = creat(newfile, 0666); // creat(newfile, 0666) = open(newfile, O_CREAT, 0666)
        if (ofd >= 0) {
            close(1); // closes existing std out 
            dup(ofd); // puts ofd in fd1
            close(ofd);
        }

Error Handling:
    - errno class stores a number when an error occurs  
    - strerr(errno) returns a description of the error
    Sample code:
        #include <errno.h>
        int ifd = open(newfile, O_RDONLY)
        if (ifd < 0) {
            printf("Error %s\n", strerr(errno)) 
        }
