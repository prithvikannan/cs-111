The following files are included in the tarball:
    lab0.c - C code for transcribing input to output 
    backtrace.png - screenshot of gdb debugging session when looking at segfault backtrace
    breakpoint.png - screenshot of gdb debugging session when setting a breakpoint before the segfault
    Makefile - makefile to build executable, check functionality, clean up files, etc.
    checker.sh - helper script called by 'make check' with smoke tests

The smoke tests are grouped by the exit code expected:
Exit code 0:
    - checks the isolated functionality of the --input flag
    - checks the isolated functionality of the --output flag
    - verify that --input actually overwrites what comes in standard in
    - verify that the contents of output matches the contents of input after runnning
Exit code 1:
    - make sure that an unknown flag is recognized as a bad flag
Exit code 2:
    - verify that a nonexistent input file is not readable
Exit code 3:
    - verify that an unwritable output file is not writable
Exit code 4:
    - check that --segfault and --catch actually create a segfault
