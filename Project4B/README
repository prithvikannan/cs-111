Project 4B
In this project I created an application that runs in an embedded system, reads data from external sensors, and logs the results.

Files included:
    Makefile - containing targets to build (in dev and prod mode), run smoke tests, create tar and cleanup
    smoketest.sh - set of tests to make sure the project is working
    README - description of project
    lab4b.c - C source files for an embedded application that builds and runs (with no errors or warnings) on an embedded system
    
Notes:
    I was having a hard time setting up the mraa libraries on my board. To solve my issue, I looked online and found a mraa install tutorial from Galen Wong (former CS111 student). Following his guidelines, I was able to install mraa. However, in the install, he notes that the spec says to do mraa_aio_init(1) but for it to work it should be mraa_aio_init(0). I have this setup by passing in a compiler flag DEV, which flips the variable in the code. I can invoke the development environment using `make dev` instead of `make prod`.
    
    My beaglebone runs version 9.5, but I have tested on another board with version 8.7.
